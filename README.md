# Final-Project
This program offers a clean, easy-to-use interface to submit an order directly from Soicy Tires.
This program is used to submit orders directly to a tire shop.

It starts with a friendly title for the shop details.

The user is prompted to enter the product ID of the item, it's product name, how many
the customer would like to order, and the cost per unit.

The user is then prompted to add any more items to their order, if so they can.

If not, the receipt is printed and sales are calculated based on order quantity, the
rate at which the item(s) cost, and tax.

The end of the receipt includes a thank you message and a note to leave a review on yelp.
